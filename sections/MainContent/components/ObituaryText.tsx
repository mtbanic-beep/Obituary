          With heavy hearts, the family of Patricia Mary Macdonald announces her
          passing. Anyone who knew Tricia knew her laughter: it was quick,
          bright, and perfectly timed. Her kindness was unmatched, and her
          presence unforgettable.

          She was welcomed to heaven with open arms by her parents, David (2012)
          and Geraldine (2007) Macdonald, and her sister, Heather Webber (2010).
          Tricia is lovingly remembered by her siblings, David and Jenny
          Macdonald (Coleman, Blake, Justin), Teri and Brian McKinnon (Sarah and
          Chris, Kate, Connor), and Jo-Anne and Kevin Watson (Jillian, Erin); as
          well as Heather’s husband, Len Webber (Lauren and Gareth, Jaime and
          Scott, and Kelly and Nathan). A loving aunt, Tricia adored her nieces
          and nephews and thrived within the amazing O’Connor Cousin Clan, who
          nurtured a deep love of family and traditional calls to gather.

          The Rothstrom family of Spokane, WA, proudly “adopted” Tricia years
          ago, something she embraced wholeheartedly. She insisted she had hit

          one.

          children, Cameron, Weston and Bennett; who she considered her family
          in every sense of the word. Her loyal dog, Piper, was never far from
          her side and brought her daily comfort and joy.

          Tricia graduated from Camosun College with a diploma in criminology.
          She worked in Calgary’s concrete and construction aggregate industry
          before finding her calling in health services, a place where her
          curiosity, empathy, and humour fit naturally. Her years with Central
          Alberta Health Services were important to her, and she valued the
          relationships she built during her time there.
